# Manage Tasks Journey

This guide explains how to manage your tasks effectively in SnapTasks.

1. **Viewing Tasks:**  
   All your added tasks appear in a scrollable list beneath the "Add Task" button.

2. **Marking a Task as Done:**  
   To mark a task as completed, swipe right on the task item. The task will be updated with a strikethrough style, and a console log will confirm the change.

3. **Deleting a Task:**  
   To remove a task, swipe left on the task item. The task will be deleted from the list, and this action is logged to the console.

4. **Feedback:**  
   Strategic logs are printed to the developer console during each action, making it easy to track task operations.
